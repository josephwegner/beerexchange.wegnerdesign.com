# The "I don't understand fancy beer" package

### For [Alex Kleissner](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPOLl5IUcAAdn-t.jpg)

Hello! Welcome to April (hopefully... I believe in you, FedEx). You've just received a pack of shitty beer from Joe Wegner! Actually, I hope it's delicious, but I honestly don't know anything about beer so good luck.

In reality, these are some things that I enjoy, and have heard that other people enjoy. They're all midwestern, mostly from Chicagoland. Unfortunately for you, prime beer season in Chicago is like a month away, so you got the next-best beer from all of my favorite breweries. Still delicious, but try again next year.

Also, as proof that I don't know enough beers, there's some coffee in here. I needed to fill space, and ran out of beer ideas. It's damn good coffee.


## Arctic Panzer  Wolf

### By [3 Floyds Brewing Co.](http://www.3floyds.com/)

So technically 3 Floyds is based in Indiana, but they're probably the best brewery in the midwest. Two of their beers - Zombie Dust and Arctic Panzer Wolf - are wildly popular. They're usually pretty hard to find, cause they get bought out so quickly.

Anyways, this lovely Arctic Panzer Wolf is an Imperial IPA. It's 9%, so be careful.

You're gonna see a lot of fruits in this one - apricot, grapefruit, orange, lemon - all those things. But it's not a pansy fruit beer; you're gonna get some pretty strong bitterness flavor here, that will last. It'll just be decorated with a fruit bowl.

I don't understand what "mouth feel" means, but people tells me it's good. I would say this one feels a lot like beer when it's in your mouth. YMMV.

## Bare Tree Weiss Wine

Two Brothers doesn't actually make that great of beer. However, they're kind of the "easy" craft beer in the midwest. Every bar carries two brothers. Every Miller-Lite-loving dad has tried, and tolerated, Two Brothers. Everyone knows what and where Two Brothers is. It's a staple in the midwest.

11%. Settle down.

This beer - their barley wine - is _not_ a staple. I don't think I've ever seen it at a bar. It's a pretty unique beer for an otherwise pretty boring brewery.

I haven't actually had the 2015 variety yet, but I hear they're all fairly similar. A good amount of spicy clovey action going on. This year the main fruit punch is apparently banana - mmmmmmm, banana beer. I hear it's actually a really strong banana flavor. Good luck.

## A Little Crazy

### By [Revolution Brewing](https://revbrew.com/)

![Crazy... like bears](http://m2.nflrush.com/bz/bearsfan.jpg)

Revolution is "the largest craft brewery" in Illinois. I believe it. They are also one of the best local breweries that does cans. That's why it's in this pack. It's good stuff - not necessarily the best - but sometimes I like drinking out of a can, and I thought you might too.

They're also based in Logan Square, which is Chicago's version of Portland. Hipster central. Don't ever go there, unless you want to suddenly have kids and buy a house and take up painting.

ANYWAYS, this is a Belgian Pale Ale, which is arguably one of my favorite kinds of beers. 6.8 ABV. A little lighter than the others.

Once again, you're gonna hit up a fair amount of citrus in this one. It's pretty light and sweet, and easy to drink. It has the kick of a pale ale, but not so much as the oh-so-trendy IPA. It has a lot of different flavors that kick in in the aftertaste. 

## Krank Shaft

### By [Metropolitan Brewing](http://metrobrewing.com/)

![I couldn't find one with beer in it...](http://comicskingdom.com/system/blog/2012/08/Crankshaft.jpg)

OK NOW THIS IS THE ONE I'M EXCITED ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Metropolitan is a little brewery in Chicago that specializes in unique German-style beers. Mostly lagers. Most of their stuff is a little weird, and won't usually show up at bars, but I love all of it.

My favorite is their Iron Works Altbier... but unfortuantely they are just starting to bottle it right now. You will have to settle for their most popular brew, Krankshaft.

Krankshaft is a Kölsch beer, traditionally made in Cologne. It's pretty much the Altbier I mentioned above, but with pale malt added in, although this specific beer also has some wheat malt in it.  It's an easy 5% ABV.

Once again, this beer will have some fruity flavor to it, specifically lemon. It's not all fruit, though - the main flavor is probably more of a bready and malty sort of beer. It's not very bitter, and is highly carbonated. Easy to drink.

Wunderbar.
